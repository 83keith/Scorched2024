# SFMLScorched
A simple Scorched Earth clone written in C++ using SFML.
Every publish of this project will be a "working" version, it may be buggy but will always work when compiled and ran with the latest version of Visual Studio.

## A work in progress
Due to the nature of this project, it is a work in progress. I will be adding features as I go along.
However, I will only be maintaining this occasionally as an excercise in "because I can", the main version of this game and activly supported will be made in Unity Framework for a more consistent and easier to maintain version for cross compatability with multiple devices.

## Support
This project is currently only supported on Windows, however, I will be adding support for Linux and Mac OS X in the future.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:
* SFML 2.4.2
